# APR Document System Database Design

## Overview
This database schema supports the APR (An√°lise Preliminar de Risco) interactive document system. It was designed with a focus on data integrity, performance, security, and flexibility to handle complex document workflows.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Document Structure
- **Flexibility**: We use a combination of relational tables and JSONB columns to balance structure and flexibility
- **Versioning**: Document revisions are tracked to maintain a complete history of changes
- **Sections**: The document is broken into logical sections for easier manipulation

### 2. Risk Assessment
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Risk tables contain multiple risk items, each with their own properties
- **Standardized Categories**: Probability, severity, and risk levels use standardized codes

### 3. User Management
- **Role-based Access**: Granular permissions system (admin, editor, viewer)
- **Document-level Permissions**: Separate table for document access rights

### 4. Security Features
- **Password Hashing**: Secure storage of user credentials
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive information is encrypted using pgcrypto
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all system actions

### 5. Performance Considerations
- **Indexing Strategy**: Indexes on frequently queried columns
- **Optimized Relationships**: Careful use of foreign keys and constraints
- **Scalability**: Design accommodates growth in users and documents

## Integration Points
- The database supports RESTful API access
- Authentication system compatible with OAuth 2.0
- Export capabilities to various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)

## Maintenance Recommendations
- Regular backups using PostgreSQL's built-in tools
- Periodic index optimization
- Monitoring query performance for potential bottlenecks

## Data Governance
- Retention policies for audit logs
- GDPR compliance considerations integrated
- Data classification for security purposes
